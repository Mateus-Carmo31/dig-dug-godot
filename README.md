# Dig Dug in Godot
Dig Dug made entirely in the Godot Engine 3.2.1

__This game was made by me entirely for learning purposes. All rights concerning the DigDug franchise of games and its assets belong to Bandai Namco Entertainment.__

Sprites were obtained from [Spriters Resource][0], and any other sprites that are not from the original game were made by me.

Music and SFX from the original game were used. They were originally composed by Yuriko Keino and were either used in their original state or recreated by me to study. Any other SFX were made by me.

Arcade font used for the UI/Text effects is [Arcade][1], by [Yuji Adachi][2]

My main references for doing this were many different ports/clones of the original game available online to play or to watch on YouTube.
